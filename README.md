Stereoscopic_3D_Display
=======================

Grabs frames from a pair of Point Grey Flea3 cameras and displays them stereoscopically for use with a 3D TV

Originally written by Cliff Bargar for the Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine Lab at Stanford University for use with the Raven-II Surgical System.
Runs in a Windows desktop environment.

You should be able to simply download and run the code in Microsoft Visual Studio and display a 3D scene from a pair of Point Grea Flea3 cameras on a compatible 3D TV (we use PG FL3-U3-32S2C-CS and Samsung UN46FH6030).
